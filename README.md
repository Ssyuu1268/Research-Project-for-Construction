# PCA-LSTM for Taiwan Construction Sector

This repository contains the code used to reproduce the *Construction* sector results in my MSc dissertation.  
It builds a **PCA-LSTM** model with **walk-forward validation** to predict monthly directional changes of Taiwanâ€™s construction sector index, and compares a baseline (no EPU) vs. models that add EPU/Tension indices.
